# HairlessFurever

Why?
I have been obsessed with hairless dogs almost my whole life. Information about them isnâ€™t readily available and is rarely in one place. When I was searching for hairless breeds, only two websites had all of the breeds listed. Even the Wikipedia article and the AKC had two to four breeds listed. I wanted to create a simple gem that I was passionate about. 

Hairless dogs are generally a good solution for people who have bad allergies and generally tend to be well natured. Many people get a dog and then have to surrender their dog due to allergies or temperament. The shelter system has systemic problems that led to so many dogs being euthanized. Many people never even consider a hairless dog as a solution to completing their family.  

Sadly a lot of the hairless breeds are very rare now and going extinct. I had to wait 5 years for a Chinese Crested puppy to go up for adoption in the US. Chinese Cresteds are one of the more popular breeds, so it goes to show how rare these majestic beasts are. People tend to be more proactive and help animals they know more about. If this gem gets one more person interested in a hairless pup, then I have done my job.

Who?
Anyone who wants to learn more about hairless dogs, dogs in general, or is wanting to get a new dog. Also if you have someone in your life that is allergic but you still want a dog, then a hairless dog is a good option. Hopefully someone can find the perfect hairless breed for themselves and have their new furever friend. 

What?
This gem will give you a list of the 10 hairless breeds that still exist. The data is scraped from Spruce Pets. Using a scraper, the index and breed name will be generated. You can then enter a number corresponding to that breed to retrieve their description, height, weight, and physical characteristics. After reading about one breed, you can choose to look at another breed or exit the program. 

#To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.
